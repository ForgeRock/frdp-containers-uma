## ForgeRock Access Manager / Amster

This project uses the ForgeRock Access Manager 6.5.2 which provides User-Manager Access (UMA) Authorization Server functionality. The ForgeRock Amster utility is used to automate the configuration of Access Manager.  Access Manager and Amster can be download from the ForgeRock [backstage](https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/am/latest) web site.  

**NOTICE:** You need an account to access the ForgeRock backstage resources.

# Setup

## hostnames

You must add the following aliases to the `/etc/hosts` file entry: `127.0.0.1   localhost`
- `as.example.com`
- `rs.example.com`

### For MacOS

```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```
Change the `127.0.0.1` line: \
**BEFORE**
```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost
```
**AFTER**
```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost as.example.com rs.example.com
```
## Environment variables

The following environment variable are used and **must** be set:

- `AM_HOST`
- `AM_PASSWORD`

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
export AM_HOST=as.example.com
export AM_PASSWORD=password
```

# Run

Make sure your terminal session has the environment variables set *(see above)*

Use the `docker-compose` command the run Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

# Verify

## Docker

After the *build* process is complete, check that the containers are running.  Open another terminal and run `docker ps`:

```bash
docker ps

```
## Authorization Server

Log into the Authorization Server as the two test users. Open browser and access ... `http://as.example.com/8080/am`

| User | Password | First name | Last name | UMA operations |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `dcrane` | `password` | Danny | Crane | Resource Owner |
| `bjensen` | `password` | Barb | Jensen | Requesting Party |

- From the top toolbar
- Select **SHARES** drop down menu
- Select **RESOURCES** menu item
- From Left Menu ...\
**My Resource** displays the user's registered UMA resources \
**Shared with Me** displays resource's the user can access

# Testing

To test the UMA environment, [**postman**](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) collections have been provided.  Start `postman` and load the *environment* json file an the two *collection* json files:

- `postman/RS.postman_environment,json`
- `postman/RO.postman_collection.json`
- `postman/RqP.postman_collection.json`

See the following instructions for **Resource Owner** and **Requesting Party** use cases.  Note: the use case instructions reference the use of *default* `postman` files ... skip this step, use the `postman` files in this project ... the environment has been pre-configured.

- [Requesting Party](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-uma-resource-server/blob/master/testing/RqP/README.md)
